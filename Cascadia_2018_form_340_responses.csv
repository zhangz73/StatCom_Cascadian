A Constitution establishes a state and is the basis for all trust within the citizenry. If properly crafted, this document can unite a people in pursuit of a common way of life.

There are questions about the structure of our new state and the powers that any new institutions might have over the citizens. We can only obtain answers by engaging with the future electorate and facilitating the decision making process.

This process provides an amazing opportunity to grow awareness of the Cascadian cause. We can recruit new Cascadians by hosting a decentralized convention across the bioregion. It should be easy to promote these events. We are literally looking for our new founding fathers. 

We have a flag, a following and an identity, now we need power. To get that, we need to organize and establish the principles that our future citizens will live by. "

After reading my explanation he said it was the best explanation of the idea he had ever heard, and was much more open to the idea. I wanted to share what I wrote with you all so you can borrow my ideas and talking points when discussing the idea with others who might look down on the idea. Below is what I wrote:

""In essence I support the Cascadia movement because I believe that collectively, our region does not share the same values, beliefs or interests with the rest of the country. I believe that Cascadia is a bioregion with some of the most amazing people, places and resources and that we would prosper under our own independent government. I believe that the United States of America that was founded in 1776 is long gone, and the only thing holding this country together is our increasingly broken political system as well as the shared history that we have. I believe that the Democratic process works best when it is well organized, and I currently don't believe ours is. I think that North America would thrive if organized into independently governed regions that cooperated economically. There's no reason that I should have to share laws with people with completely different values if we would both be happier/better off operating with different rules. Does that make sense?"""
